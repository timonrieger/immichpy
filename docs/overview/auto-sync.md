# Auto syncing

**immich-py** stays in sync with upstream Immich automatically. When Immich ships changes, a workflow regenerates the client + docs and opens a pull request with the updates.

## What gets autogenerated

From the Immich OpenAPI spec, the project generates:

- the client's API groups
- the CLI commands
- the CLI reference documentation
- the client reference documentation

## Single source of truth

The single source of truth is the upstream Immich OpenAPI spec: [immich-openapi-specs.json](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/blob/main/open-api/immich-openapi-specs.json)
