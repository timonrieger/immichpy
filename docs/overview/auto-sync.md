# Auto syncing

**immichpy** stays in sync with upstream Immich automatically. When Immich ships changes, a workflow opens a pull request with the updates, which is then merged by a maintainer.

Most releases are one-click merges, and some require only very small adjustments. Typically, this happens within 24 hours of the Immich release.
