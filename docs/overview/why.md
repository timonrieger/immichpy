# Why immich-py?

### 1. Thin, schema-driven design
immich-py isn't a hand-written abstraction. It's autogenerated directly from the Immich OpenAPI schema using the well-established [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator). Its core is mostly models and endpoint mappings rather than complex custom logic. If needed, the project can be easily forked or regenerated from the schema, avoiding lock-in to heavy abstractions.

### 2. Focused on API stability
The primary goal of immich-py is to track Immich API changes quickly and maintain compatibility with server releases. It acts as a stable buffer layer so downstream projects don't have to adjust to every API change themselves.

### 3. Minimal lock-in
Using immich-py does not change your architecture — it simply replaces manual HTTP calls with typed endpoint functions. If a project later decides to remove the dependency, the calls map directly back to the raw API, avoiding any architectural dead ends.

### 4. Longevity
immich-py is designed as a shared, reliable API layer for Python projects in the Immich ecosystem, not just a single-use library. While the project is still young, its foundations are solid:
- The code generation approach is mature and well-tested
- The client structure is based on patterns already used in production systems
The main area that evolves is API tracking, not the internal design.

### 5. Automated maintenance
The client reduces risk of staleness through automation:
- Full test suite
- Automatic documentation generation
- Release sync automation
For every Immich release, a pull request is automatically generated to update the client. Most releases are one-click merges, and some require only very small adjustments.

### 6. Ecosystem alignment
immich-py is maintained by a contributor active in the wider Immich team and ecosystem. Ongoing contributions to core and tooling ensure the client evolves in step with the platform, making it a reliable, ecosystem-oriented API layer rather than an isolated side project.
