# Why immich-py?

### 1. Thin, schema-driven design
immich-py isn't a hand-written abstraction. It's autogenerated directly from the Immich OpenAPI schema using the well-established [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator). Its core is mostly models and endpoint mappings rather than complex custom logic. If needed, the project can be easily forked or regenerated from the schema.

### 2. Focused on API stability
The primary goal of immich-py is to track Immich API changes quickly and maintain compatibility with server releases. It acts as a stable buffer layer so downstream projects don't have to adjust to every API change themselves. Read more about [versioning](./versioning.md).

### 3. Minimal lock-in
Using immich-py does not change your architecture - it simply replaces manual HTTP calls with typed endpoint functions. If a project later decides to remove the dependency, the calls map directly back to the raw API, avoiding any architectural dead ends. Read more about the [integration](./integration-guide.md).

### 4. Longevity
immich-py is designed as a shared, reliable API layer for Python projects in the Immich ecosystem, not just a single-use library. While the project is still young, its foundations are solid:

- The code generation approach is mature and well-tested
- The client structure is based on patterns already used in production systems

The main area that evolves is API tracking, not the internal design.

### 5. Automated maintenance
The client reduces risk of staleness through automation. For every Immich release, a pull request is opened to update the client. Read more about [auto-syncing](./auto-sync.md).

### 6. Ecosystem alignment
**immich-py** is maintained by me, [@timonrieger](https://github.com/timonrieger). I'm actively involved in the broader Immich ecosystem, contributing to core and related projects to help keep this client aligned with the platform's evolution.
