# Getting Started

**immich-py** is an unofficial Python SDK and CLI for the [Immich](https://immich.app) API. It provides two main ways to interact with your Immich server:

## Python Client

The Python client library allows you to interact with Immich programmatically from your Python applications. It provides full type safety and async support.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides a convenient way to interact with Immich from the terminal, perfect for automation, scripting, and quick operations.

## Installation

Both the client and CLI are included in the same package:

```bash
pip install immich
```

For CLI-specific features:

```bash
pip install immich[cli]
```
