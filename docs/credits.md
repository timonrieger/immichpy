# Credits

This project is built on top of several excellent open-source projects:

## [Immich](https://immich.app/)

The exceptional self-hosted photo and video management solution that this SDK and CLI are built for. Immich provides a powerful API that makes projects like this possible.

## [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)

The CLI framework powering the Immich CLI. Typer makes it easy to build command-line applications with automatic help, shell completion, and a great developer experience — all based on Python type hints.

## [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)

The tool used to generate the Python client from the Immich OpenAPI specification. This enables the SDK to stay in sync with the latest Immich API automatically.

## [Zensical](https://zensical.org/)

The modern static site generator used to build this documentation. Built by the creators of Material for MkDocs, it provides a powerful and easy-to-use documentation platform.

## [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

A fast Python package and project manager, used for dependency management and development workflows.

## [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)

A polyglot tool version manager used to manage Python versions and development tools across the project.
