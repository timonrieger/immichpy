commit_message
- Always follow the Conventional Commits specification:
  https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
- Format must be: <type>: <short description>
- Types: feat, fix, perf,build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, test
- Do not include scope in the format (e.g., feat: ...).
- Use imperative mood in the description (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds").
- Keep subject line under 72 characters.
- If necessary, add a blank line after the subject and include a longer body.
- Body should explain *what* and *why*, not *how*.
- Use bullet points for multiple changes in the body.
- Reference issues/tickets in the footer when applicable (e.g., "Closes #123").

examples
- "feat: add JWT authentication middleware"
- "fix: handle null pointer in user response"
- "docs: update installation instructions"
- "refactor: simplify button component props"
- "test: add integration tests for nested routes"
